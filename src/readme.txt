1. Problem Analysis
---------

Summarize the analysis work you did. 
What new information did it reveal?  How did this help you?
How much time did you spend on problem analysis?

	I read the write up, and then i realized that bankFile is checked no matter
	if the user is going into batch mode or bank mode. I spent a minimum of 20
	minutes on problem analysis.

2. Design
---------

Explain the design you developed to use and why. What are the major 
components? What connects to what? How much time did you spend on design?
Make sure to clearly show how your design uses the MVC model by
separating the UI "view" code from the back-end game "model".

	I used an MVC Model, for the design. The Bank connects to the Bank GUI, 
	while the Bank GUI gets all the vital informations from the Bank Model. The 
	Atm GUI also connects to the Atm Model which is connected to the Bank Model,
	in order to access the accounts. A total of about 8 hours was put into the 
	making of the design

3. Implementation and Testing
-------------------

Describe your implementation efforts here; this is the coding and testing.

What did you put into code first?
How did you test it?
How well does the solution work? 
Does it completely solve the problem?
Is anything missing?
How could you do it differently?
How could you improve it?

How much total time would you estimate you worked on the project? 
If you had to do this again, what would you do differently?

	The first thing i put into the code was the read file, which will make testing
	my batch mode good. My solution works very well, even better than i expected
	The solution solves complete the problem, and there is nothing missing.
	I dont think i would do it differently, but i could have added some type of pictures
	do make it alittle fancy. This project took me a total of let me say 8 hrs.
	If i had a chance to do this again, i wont do it any different, but add a delete account
	into the bank GUI.

4. Development Process
-----------------------------

Describe your development process here; this is the overall process.

How much problem analysis did you do before your initial coding effort?
How much design work and thought did you do before your initial coding effort?
How many times did you have to go back to assess the problem?

What did you learn about software development?

	There wasnt alot of problem analysis and design work done  before the initial coding,
	I just brushed through the problem analysis and design work just to start coding.
	However while i was coding, I went back a lot, to assess the problem, because sometimes
	I feel I was doing it the wrong way.
	
	I learned that software development is fun but tedious.
